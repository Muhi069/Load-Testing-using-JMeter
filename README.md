# Load-Testing

Load Testing is a type of Performance Testing that determines the performance of a system, software product, or software application under real-life based load conditions. Basically, load testing determines the behavior of the application when multiple users use it at the same time. It is the response of the system measured under varying load conditions. The load testing is carried out for normal and extreme load conditions. 

Objectives of Load Testing: The objective of load testing is:

To maximize the operating capacity of a software application.
To determine whether the latest infrastructure is capable to run the software application or not.
To determine the sustainability of application with respect to extreme user load.
To find out the total count of users that can access the application at the same time.
To determine scalability of the application.
To allow more users to access the application.
